# nonogram
Nonogram game (Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, and Pic-a-Pix) in Processing.

To play, download the code and run it on Processing 3 (or 4).


Select either "10x10" or "15x15". The first will render a 10x10 grid, and the latter, a 15x15 grid. The numbers always change and the final design too. Check whether your solution is right or not by clicking "Check." If you want to go back to the menu, click on the top left button.
